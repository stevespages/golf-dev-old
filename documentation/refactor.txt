Remove php/ajax.php and most all the functions it calls from php/db-functions.php

Create php/ajax/get-teams.php (one file for each ajax call)
    This should have all the code in it for the ajax call. Do not reference a separate file for it.

In javascript/modules/competition-admin.js
    xhr.open(
        "GET",
        "../php/ajax/get-teams.php?"
        + "param=value",
        true
    );

Change competition-administration to competition-admin everywhere
